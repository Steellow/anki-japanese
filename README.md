# Japanese Anki deck 🇯🇵

My Anki deck to learn Japanese. I don't really care about being able to write, so this deck is only for reading. All cards include voices as well.

## How to use

1. Install [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/)
   - `brew install --cask anki` || `sudo apt install anki` || `pacman -S anki`
2. Go to File → Import... (`⇧ + ⌘ + I`) and select [Japanese 🇯🇵.apkg](./Japanese%20%F0%9F%87%AF%F0%9F%87%B5.apkg)
   - Or just open the file and it will be automatically opened with Anki

## Subdecks

- Adding more content/subdecks as I progress with my Japanese
- Pretty much just copied from other users with little tweaks
